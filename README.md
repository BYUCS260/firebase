This tutorial is intended to give you some basic information about how to use firebase authentication and the firestore database.
## Introduction
Firebase is a backend-as-a-service (BaaS) offering by Google that features databases, an ML kit, cloud functions, authentication, hosting, cloud storage, and more. Firebase abstracts the complexity of building a robust and scalable backend system, enabling developers to focus on building the client side of applications.
## Firebase Setup
